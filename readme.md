# Transistor Level Circuit Designer

## Purpose 

How do I design a Efficient Circuit - Given the Truth table

This app will allow you to do just that for circuits with up to 7 unique inputs.

It uses Genetic Algorithms to arrive at the final circuit that is constructed purely with Dynamic CMOS units.

## The App

The input is a single string which is the required truth table.
